    "* The data was exported as a CSV file. We did not remove any columns so that we could analyze all the different types of delays as well as geographic and carrier information.

    "* The data was exported as a CSV file. We removed unnecessary columns and added a couple of new columns to make our analysis easier. In addition, we compressed certain rows based on state, month, and year to ensure that our data were consistent with the airline delay dataset. The initial dataset was organized by day. A lot of these edits were made so as to ensure it was a fully usable dataset, and as well to ensure that there were no values that were null or would affect our analysis work. More specifically, our cleaning focused on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converting objects to DateTime: This was a significant step, because much of our analysis required us to pull dates from the datasets. Unfortunately, the dates were not formatted within the CSV as DateTime objects, and thus our job was simply to transform these dates into DateTime objects. This was done using the pandas to_datetime() function, and assisted the team immensely in being able to directly pull the dates/times in a usable form for our data analysis. By being able to have these dates in DateTime objects, we are then able to use them without issue (in comparison to strings or other types) within our data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding month and year columns: In order to join the datasets by state, we needed to create new columns for the year and month of each record. This was simple since we already converted dates into DateTime objects. By adding these two columns, we were able to sum the covid cases and group by state, year, and month. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Removing all attributes except year\t, month, state, tot_case, and new_case: We made the conscious decision to only use year, month, state, total cases, and new cases. We decided to omit the rest because our research question only pertains to COVID-19 cases, and not deaths. Moreover, we are not concerned with probable cases as the data is subjective based on whether or not consent was given to include those metrics. As a result, we decided to stick only with objective data for our analysis."

    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression 1 ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran a multiple linear regression model for all covid cases and flight delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression 2 ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran a multiple linear regression model for all covid cases and carrier delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression 3 ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We also ran one for carrier_ct in states with the most and least covid in the United States. We wanted to predict how a state's new number of covid cases and the time can predict the number of delays. For the 8 states we ran the model on, the highest R2 score we got was 0.22. This is not a significant result, which tells us that time and number of new cases do not have a statisitcally significant impact on number of airline delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting factor is the difference in R2, MAE, MSE, amd model scores between states with the highest number of COVID cases and states with the lowest number of cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The R2 scores for the 4 states with **less** COVID cases are multiple times greater than for the 4 states with the **most** COVID cases. \n",
    "- Additionally, model scores for test and train data for states with **less COVID** cases were ranged higher than model scores with **greater COVID numbers**. \n",
    "- Similarly, MAE and MSE scores were **lower** for the states with **less** COVID cases than they were for states with **higher** COVID numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our **R2** results mean that our regression model performed better for the 4 states with the **lowest number of COVID cases** than the 4 states with the highest number of COVID cases. The difference in **model scores** tell us that this model was more representative of the data for the 4 states with the least # of COVID cases than for the 4 states with greater COVID rates. The lower error scores (MAE and MSE) tell us that the predicted values were closer to the actual values for the 4 states with the **least amount of COVID cases**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our R2, test/train model scores, and MAE/MSE statistics were better for the 4 states with **less COVID cases**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",
    "Due to the unexpected and immense challenges faced by the airline industry as a result of the recent pandemic, it's possible that flight data is too highly variable to make accurate predictions using ML models. Our model was ultimately not accurate nor representative of the data for the 8 states we tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that **for the 8 states we tested, higher COVID rates correlated with worse flight delay predictions.** Although the the model was not particularly effective for any states we chose, the statistics summarized above show that our model was **more accurate and more representative** of the data for WY, DC, VT, and VI: the 4 states with the **least COVID cases**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although flight delays and COVID cases have increased similarly over time, we conclude that it is not possible to accurately predict flight delays given the current data set. In addition, we found that flight delay predictions for the 4 states with the lowest number of COVID cases were far more accurate than the predictions for the 4 states with the highest number of COVID cases"

    "# Limitations #\n",
    "In our study, we were not able to identify exactly which delays were caused by covid-related causes, which impacted the results of our study. While we were able to identify what delays were caused by carrier-related errors, not all of these delays were caused by covid issues, and could be caused by other logistical issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **First Data Set (Flight Delays)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data is somewhat limited because it does not include all flight data for the specified time period. Although the US has ​​19,622 airports, the data only includes information about 384 airports. Another limitation is that the data does not cover delays experienced by flights operated by US-based airlines but originating or arriving at airports outside the US. Although we are looking at the relationship between COVID-19 cases and delays in the US, international statistics could potentially affect our data too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Second Data Set (COVID-19 Cases)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are several limitations to any COVID-19 dataset. First, there is a lot of noise and misinformation surrounding the pandemic, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. Secondly, different jurisdictions handle their data differently, making it difficult to get a complete picture of the pandemic within the United States. The data may also be affected by political and geographical demographics."

    "## Questions for reviewers \n",
    "1. Should we consider population of a given state when analyzing our data?\n",
    "2. Should we consider population of a given state when analyzing our data?\n",
    "\n",
    " If you think there is some interesting analyses that you could incorporate if you use population data, then yes! Looking at your data right now, I could population data maybe be helpful for a percentage statistic (what percentage of a state population had covid in a given time period. It could also be helpful to scale covid cases using population of state because larger states would most likely have more covid cases. I think including it could add a layer of complexity and yield interesting statistics, but I dont think it is necessary.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Should we format all graph date axes the same way or is it okay if we specify differences in the header?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fine to have different formats as long as the scale you are using makes sense based on the data and it is clear from the title and axis labels what you are plotting. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are our variable names written in an understandeable manner?\n",
    "The column names look fine to me, I would note that when you plot them it would be helpful to change the name to something more immediately understandable. For example, in your graph for Delays by Airline at JFK for July 2022, the axis label arr_del15 could be changed to something more informative, but using your current column names for analyses is completely acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Since the COVID dataset contains monthly totals for each state, should we group together airports in the same state for flight delays or evaluate them individually?\n",
    "I think it might be interesting to do both. I wouldnt only group together airports in the same state, but this could be an interesting additional. One thing that concerns me slightly is that not all the people in an airport would test positive for covid within the state that the airport is located in.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. Are there other relationships for the vars that we should be evaluating?\n",
    "I think your EDA was pretty encompassing regarding the flight dataset, but I think it would be worth exploring more relationships between the two datasets you have, especially since it concerns your research question. For example, I think it could be interesting to look into arr_delay to see what the relationship is between covid and the actual number of minutes the flight was delayed."
