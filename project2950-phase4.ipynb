In addition, we compressed certain rows based on state, month, and year to ensure that our data were consistent with the airline delay dataset. The initial dataset was organized by day. A lot of these edits were made so as to ensure it was a fully usable dataset, and as well to ensure that there were no values that were null or would affect our analysis work. More specifically, our cleaning focused on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converting objects to DateTime: This was a significant step, because much of our analysis required us to pull dates from the datasets. Unfortunately, the dates were not formatted within the CSV as DateTime objects, and thus our job was simply to transform these dates into DateTime objects. This was done using the pandas to_datetime() function, and assisted the team immensely in being able to directly pull the dates/times in a usable form for our data analysis. By being able to have these dates in DateTime objects, we are then able to use them without issue (in comparison to strings or other types) within our data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding month and year columns: In order to join the datasets by state, we needed to create new columns for the year and month of each record. This was simple since we already converted dates into DateTime objects. By adding these two columns, we were able to sum the covid cases and group by state, year, and month. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Removing all attributes except year\t, month, state, tot_case, and new_case: We made the conscious decision to only use year, month, state, total cases, and new cases. We decided to omit the rest because our research question only pertains to COVID-19 cases, and not deaths. Moreover, we are not concerned with probable cases as the data is subjective based on whether or not consent was given to include those metrics. As a result, we decided to stick only with objective data for our analysis."

    "2. Should we consider population of a given state when analyzing our data?\n",
    "\n",
    " If you think there is some interesting analyses that you could incorporate if you use population data, then yes! Looking at your data right now, I could population data maybe be helpful for a percentage statistic (what percentage of a state population had covid in a given time period. It could also be helpful to scale covid cases using population of state because larger states would most likely have more covid cases. I think including it could add a layer of complexity and yield interesting statistics, but I dont think it is necessary.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Should we format all graph date axes the same way or is it okay if we specify differences in the header?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fine to have different formats as long as the scale you are using makes sense based on the data and it is clear from the title and axis labels what you are plotting. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Are our variable names written in an understandeable manner?\n",
    "The column names look fine to me, I would note that when you plot them it would be helpful to change the name to something more immediately understandable. For example, in your graph for Delays by Airline at JFK for July 2022, the axis label arr_del15 could be changed to something more informative, but using your current column names for analyses is completely acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Since the COVID dataset contains monthly totals for each state, should we group together airports in the same state for flight delays or evaluate them individually?\n",
    "I think it might be interesting to do both. I wouldnt only group together airports in the same state, but this could be an interesting additional. One thing that concerns me slightly is that not all the people in an airport would test positive for covid within the state that the airport is located in.\n",
    " \n",
    "6. Are there other relationships for the vars that we should be evaluating?\n",
    "I think your EDA was pretty encompassing regarding the flight dataset, but I think it would be worth exploring more relationships between the two datasets you have, especially since it concerns your research question. For example, I think it could be interesting to look into arr_delay to see what the relationship is between covid and the actual number of minutes the flight was delayed."
